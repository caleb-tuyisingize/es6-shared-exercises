### SHORT EXERCISES
# EXERCISES 1
```bash
comparing var with let
WHEN using var for declaring a variable THEN the scope of the variable is the surrounding function
    if (true) {
     var varX = true;
    }
    assert.equal(varX, true);
```
# EXERCISES 2
```bash
WHEN declaring a variable using let THEN the scope is limited to the surrounding block (enclosed in { and })
    if (true) {
    let letX = true;
    }
assert.throws(() => letX, ReferenceError);
```
# EXERCISES 3

```bash
using let
WHEN using let in a for loop THEN the variable is only "visible" inside this loop
    let obj = {x: 1};
for (let key in obj) {}
assert.throws(() => key, ReferenceError);
```
# EXERCISES 4

```bash
WHEN embedding a let variable in a block (using curly braces) THEN the variable is not "visible" outside of it
let variable ;
assert.strictEqual(variable, undefined);
```

# EXERCISES 5

```bash
const is like let plus read-only
scalar values are read-only
e.g. a number
const constNum = 0;


🍀 A new find or treasured gem, cherish it!

or a string
const constString = 'I am a const';


🍀 A new find or treasured gem, cherish it!

complex types are NOT fully read-only
array`s items can be changed
arr[0] = 42;


🎈 Mastery in every glimpse.

object`s can be modified
``` 

# EXERCISES ON JSHERO

```bash 
Several variables
Several variables are declared and initialized in 2 program lines:
let city = 'Lubumbashi';
let country = 'Congo';
Exercise

What is x?
Let's practice what we've just learned. Here you have to read code.
Exercise

Variables
JavaScript programs consist of a series of statements. Each statement performs an elementary operation. By executing many instructions you can finally solve complex tasks. Each statement is written in a line and closed with a semicolon.

An elementary statement is the declaration and initialization of a variable. A variable is a container for a value. The statement
let city = 'Porbandar';
declares a variable with the name city and initializes it with the value 'Porbandar'. The variable is declared with the keyword let. Use the equals sign, the assignment operator, to assign a value to the variable. Note: JavaScript is case-sensitive. city and City are two different variables.
Exercise
Declare a variable firstname and initialize it with the value 'Lata'.
+ Hint
+ Solution
let firstname  = 'Lata'
